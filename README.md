_Radicle terminal user interfaces_

## Installation

**Requirements**

- _Linux_ or _Unix_ based operating system.
- Git 2.34 or later
- OpenSSH 9.1 or later with `ssh-agent`

### ðŸ“¦ From source

> Requires the Rust toolchain.

You can install the binary from source, by running the following
commands from inside this repository:

    cargo install --path . --force --locked

Or directly from our seed node:

    cargo install --force --locked --git https://seed.radicle.xyz/z39mP9rQAaGmERfUMPULfPUi473tY.git

This will install `rad-tui`. You can execute it by running `rad tui`. All available commands can be shown by running `rad tui --help`.

## Interfaces

The Radicle terminal interfaces are designed to be modular and to integrate well with the existing Radicle CLI. Right now, they are meant to be called from other programs that will collect and process their output.
